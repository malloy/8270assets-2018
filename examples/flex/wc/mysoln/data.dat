There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
Omitted, and all the rest of thier lives are
bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat, and
we must take the current when it serves
or we will lose our ventures.
	Mark Anthony, Ceasar, W. Shakespeare
Taken from page 171 of Shakespeare's grave.
