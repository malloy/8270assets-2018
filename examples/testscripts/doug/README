makeCase is a bash script that runs python against a test case in the
cases directory.

Usage: makeCase <testcasename>

For example makeCase 1 will read cases/1.py into the real python interpreter
and send the output to cases/1.out, redirecting error to /dev/null

This is only useful if your program creates output that matches the actual
python interpreter. My program for example, does not handle repeating decimals
the same way python does, so for my test cases I picked decimals that don't repeat.

To run the actual test caess, I used the professor's original test.py.
